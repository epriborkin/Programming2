## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. These
## functions are used cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function makes a matrix that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}
## This function calculates the matrix's inverse. It checks if
## the inverse has already been computed. If it does, the result comes up and and the computation does not. If the inverse has not been computed, 
## the computation of the inverse pops up, and the setinverse function gets the inverse into the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if (!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(mat, ...)
  x$setInverse(inv)
  inv
}
